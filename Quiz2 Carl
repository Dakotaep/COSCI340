/*
 
 Program by Carl. Give me comments if you have them.
 
 This program asks the user to pick a number from 1 - 10.
 This number then generates a corresponding number of random numbers with a range of 1 - 4.
 The program then will tell the user how many occurrences of 1, 2, 3, and 4 there were.
 
 Not yet implemented:
 The frequency of each random number needs to be printed on the screen.
 General input validation.
